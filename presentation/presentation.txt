Why?
	* Who here has written a build script in msbuild or nant?
		* How many lines of code was it?
		* How many times did you need to write a custom task?
		* How many times was it possible for a colleague to modify it without you helping?
	* I wrote first msbuild project 3 years ago
		* Painful to maintain
			* Never remembered the syntax for the collection types
			* Always had to re-learn how to use it
		* No-one else wanted to learn it to be able to change it
			* I'm the only one able to change it - and it hurts

What?
	* rake is "Ruby make"
	* make is a build tool; one deals with tasks, and files, and dependencies between the two
		* Example - compile a set of .o file from a .c file with a cc command
		* Example - create a zip file of the output for deployment
		* Example - find out whether a service is running, and if not; start it
		* Example - compile a .NET dll from a c# project file with an msbuild command
	* Ruby is a dynamic scripting language
		* When have you ever called a build script anything but a "script"?  XML/declarative-approach is the wrong abstraction to apply for a build script

How?
	* Install steps:
		* Install ruby - one-click installer to c:\ruby (might even work with IronRuby; haven't tried)
		* gem install rake
		* (optional) gem install rake-dotnet
	* Simplistic - wrap msbuild and call it to build the solution
		Example: how_1_msbuild/Rakefile.rb
		rake
			runs clean, then build
		rake clean
			runs clean
		rake clean build
			runs clean, then build
		rake clean build --trace
			ditto with more output
		
	* Supply some parameters from the command-line
		Example: how_2_parameters/Rakefile.rb
		rake CONFIGURATION=Release
			runs clean, then build, passing in 'Release' as a parameter
		
	* Wrap other command line tools and call them
		Example: how_3_console_tool_wrap/Rakefile.rb
		rake 
	
	* Demo clean/clobber
		Example: how_4_clean/Rakefile.rb
		rake default clean --trace
			build then call clean; deletes the intermediate files but not the output files
		rake default clobber --trace
			build then call clobber; deletes the intermediate files AND the output files - idea is to bring us back to fresh-checkout state
	
	* Demo custom rake task
		Example: how_5_xunit/Rakefile.rb
		rake -T
			observe, documentation for the tasks decorated with desc
		rake
			build and run some tests
		make a test break
			build and see broken test
	
	* Make it by-conventional
		gem install rake-dotnet (need internet connection)
		Example: ../DemoRoot
		rake
