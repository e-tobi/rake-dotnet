Why?
	* Wrote first msbuild project 3 years ago
	* Painful to maintain
		* Never remembered the syntax for the collection types
		* Always had to re-learn how to use it
		* No-one else wanted to learn it to be able to change it
			* I'm the only one able to change it - and it hurts

What?
	* rake is "Ruby make"
	* make is a build tool; one deals with tasks, and files, and dependencies between the two
		* Example - compile a .o file from a .c file with a cc command
		* Example - compile a .NET dll from a c# project file with an msbuild command
	* Ruby is a dynamic scripting language
		* When have you ever called a build script anything but a "script"?  XML/declarative-approach is the wrong abstraction to apply

How?
	* Simplistic - wrap msbuild and call it
	* Wrap other command line tools and call them
	* Make it conventional
