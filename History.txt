=== 0.0.8 / 2009-?



=== 0.0.7 / 2009-04-15

* CHANGE: Adjust TOOLS_DIR initialisation so it looks for a shared 3rdparty folder at the same level as the product folder first, then it looks for a 3rdparty folder inside of the product folder.
* CHANGE: Adjust the Demo's Rakefile to make FxCop ignore assemblies with "Tests" in their filename.

=== 0.0.6 / 2009-04-06

* Move source control to github at http://github.com/petemounce/rake-dotnet
* Change format of readme to markdown for prettiness on the repo homepage
* FIX: YYYYMMDD is invalid for file/assembly-version attribute; use '0' instead in non-svn source-control case.
* FIX: Fix harvesting a web-application when it's not under svn source-control

=== 0.0.5 / 2009-04-03

* Support non-svn version-control.  In this case, write today's date as YYYYMMDD into revision number of assembly version.
* Write ncover reports into out/reports/ncover, since there may be many, and there are some asset files too.
* Generate the {project}/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs in place rather than making users add a link to the common one (friction)
* Generate the {project}/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs from either a .template next-door, or the common template in {src_dir}
* Change the name of the AssemblyInfo template because if it ends in .cs msbuild assumes it should be compiled, which will then fail. 

=== 0.0.4 / 2009-03-31

* Gem publishing snafu on my part.

=== 0.0.3 / 2009-03-30

* Bugfix release

	* SevenZip now uses the 7za command-line archiver by default.
	* Can now pass in VERBOSE=true to listen to cp/mv logging-to-console on file operations.
	* Correctly package web-applications now.
	* Copy, don't move, when packaging.

=== 0.0.2 / 2009-03-21

* Several major enhancements

	* Versioner
		* Figure out a 4-token version number, major.minor.build.revision, taking:
			* major.minor from version.template.txt
			* build from ENV['BUILD_NUMBER'] (used by TeamCity)
			* revision from svn working copy that the build is occurring in
	
	* AssemblyInfoTask
		* Create AssemblyInfo.cs file(s) based on supplied AssemblyInfo.template.cs file(s)
		* Perform token replacement within AssemblyInfo.cs to watermark assemblies with:
			* major.minor.build.revision version number (from RDNVERSION)
			* Product Name (from PRODUCT_NAME)
			* Company Name (from COMPANY_NAME)
			* Build configuration (from CONFIGURATION)
	
	* MsBuildTask
		* Perform compilation of msbuild project files
	
	* HarvestOutputTask
		* Harvest output of projects to a directory to act as main dumping ground to then zip up for build-artifacts to enable CI-parallelisation later
		
	* HarvestWebApplicationTask
		* Harvest web-applications (greedily) to a directory
	
	* XUnitTask
		* Run xunit.net tests from assemblies with *Tests* in filename
	
	* FxCopTask
		* Run fxcop against assemblies whose filenames contain PRODUCT_NAME
	
	* NCoverTask
		* Run ncover.console against assemblies to generate coverage data
		* Run ncover.reporting against coverage data to generate coverage reports
			* Limited to simple case in this release
	
	* RDNPackageTask
		* Package a directory as a zip file, named like {name}-{configuration}-v{version}.zip
		* Uses 7-zip, instead of rake's built-in PackageTask, which would have required taking a dependency on cygwin (7-zip is lighter)
		
	* A demo solution as an example of usage
		* See http://my-svn.assembla.com/svn/nrws/trunk/rake_dotnet/lib/Demo

=== 0.0.1 / 2009-03-09

* 1 major enhancement

  * Birthday!
